# PCA Face Demo
This is a small demo application to show how PCA can be used to generate data from an input vector. 

There are two components to this application, some python code which uses scikit-learn and the Olivetti faces dataset to perform PCA. And a simple webpage which takes the component matrix and means and performs the image generation.

A live demonstration can be accessed [here](https://pca-face.surge.sh)
